# Flappy-Bird

This an a clone of the popular ios app flappy bird. It was made with the use of sprite kit. I developed it in XCode. The main script that is running is in the file name GameViewController.swift and GameScene.swift. The whole application was developed in the swift programming language.

To run this program you need xcode and if you download it and upload it in xcode you will be able to play it.
